---

---

## Features (Jo)

## Demo

### ‚è≥ Additional Features - Chun
There were a few features we were unable to incorporate into the MVP due to time constraints.
* Make the SOS message customizable.
* Upload a profile picture, or fetch the avatar image from Slack
* Read content of an individual message, including the "Send Love" feature.

---

### ‚è≥ Additional Features
* Receive and store the user's Slack workspace ID / authentication. 
* Video tutorial
* More slack channels associated with different users
* Be able to send audio/voice messages


---


## CHALLENGES - NAFISA 


## üè´ :key: Key Learnings
* React router to serve different pages for diferent users
* A thorough understanding of using package.json, .env and how to alleviate nested package hell!
* Implementing and customising Slack APIs in React
* How to scope an MVP properly and prototype in Figma

---

## Code Learnings :pencil: 

- Don't do response.json twice in a fetch  (Body consumed error)

---


<Redirect to="sfsdf"> --> return this in form handleSubmit function, rather than have a button wrapped in a <Link>

---

We need CORS redirect info in our header to allow requests to come from the same origin

---


.ENV needed for both client AND server 

---

## Challenges

 - Node versions- we did `volta install node@14.17.0` to get us all on the same version
 - we were on different npm versions so had to install npm i react-is because we were getting this error 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/uxbwKcn.png)

 - Different npm versions :confounded: 
 
 ---
 
 
## Challenges
 
- make sure your npm packages are installed in the right place
- Having two package.jsons- then one - then two
- Sending via a proxy server
- Built-in linting that comes with the create react app caused errors
- Sending speech to text message to slack, it sends twice right now :shrug: 
- testing api calls
