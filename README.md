## Using this project

1. Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fac21/final-project-telegran.git

2. Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

3. Start the server

   You can start the server on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Run the React application on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Run both applications together with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.
